## API REST WITH NODE AND LITTLE FRONTEND INTEGRATION

In this project I created, first of all, a backend API Rest with posts.

With these funcionality anyone can **CREATE** a post, **GET** all of them, **GET** only one by id, **DELETE** one post and **UPDATE** one selected also by id.

Finally, I fetched it to show on a frontend window like this.

#### TECHNOLOGIES

This workspace was developed with Node.Js technology in the backend, Mongo as the database and simple HTML, CSS and Javascript on the frontend.

I also used libraries like Express, Mongoose, Nodemon, Dotenv, Body Parser and Cors.
